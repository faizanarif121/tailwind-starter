# Tailwind starter

Project built for projects that don't require any framework, plain html pages with tailwind

The project uses the Tailwind purge to make the files as clean as possible.

## Installation

The installation is very easy run the install command.

```bash
npm install
```

Next up we can run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And your website will start up automatically in your default browser.


## Modifying the project

You can then modify the `tailwind.config.js` for your own custom colors if needed
And modify the `index.html` inside the `src` directory.
